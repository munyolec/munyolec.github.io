# Twitter Analysis of Influential People and Top Governement Leaders 
I recently did an analysis to identify top social media influencers in Africa for a digital campaign. The purpose was to identify which of these influencers a company can partner with or hire to amplify their planned digital campaign. It was also  to identify the topics that are important to these influencers.


``` python
def hello_world():
    print("hello world!)
print(hello world())
```

``` python
hello world!
```
